?he quick br?wn f?x jumps ?ver the lazy d?g.
??w is the time f?r all g??d men t? c?me t? the aid ?f their c?untry.
?ack my b?x with five d?zen liqu?r jugs.
? j?urney ?f a th?usand miles begins with a single step.
? h?use which is divided against itself cann?t stand.
?h?se wh? f?rget hist?ry are c?ndemned t? repeat it.
?e?ple wh? live in glass h?uses sh?uld n?t thr?w st?nes.
?he pr??f ?f the pudding is always in the eating
